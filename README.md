Data for the article "Unsupervised neural networks for identification of aging con-ditions in Li-ion batteries" by Pablo Pastor-Flores, Bonifacio Martín-del-Brío, Antonio Bono-Nuez, Iván Sanz-Gorrachategui and Carlos Bernal-Ruiz. In MDPI Electronics, Special Issue "Machine Learning and Smart Sensing".

The dataset consists of thirteen NCA (LiNiCoAlO2) 18650 Li-ion cells with a nominal voltage and capacity of 3.6 V and 3.2 Ah respectively. Cells were continuously cycled in environmental chambers simulating real condi-tions of usage with a different profile for each cell (different Vmax, charge/discharge rates, temperatures…), thus, each cell suffered different degradation processes depending on each specific application.
